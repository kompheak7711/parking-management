## Q-2026-10-03-1 — Slice 2 stopped: findings remain after review round 2

Slice 2 (financial.approve, final_settlements.prepare and the draft model, migration `20261012_77`) is built and its tests pass, but the second and last allowed review round still has findings. Under ops/V1_056_TAKEOVER.md sections 4 and 6 the work stopped. Nothing of slice 2 is committed; the files are in the working tree. Full record: ops/reviews/V1-056-slice-02-financial-drafts.md.

Remaining findings (no blockers):

1. Should-fix (test only): add tests that a repeated withdraw or reject after a decision with a wrong authorization reference is refused, and that a correct repeat replays.
2. Should-fix (test only): add tests that reject and withdraw refuse a blank, padded or missing reason, through the service and directly in the database, and write no decision.
3. Note (code): give `app.confirm_financial_draft_record` a draft-kind parameter and check it, so a later confirm command for one kind can never confirm a draft of another kind.
4. Note (code): add type checks in `FinancialDraftPage` and the withdraw capability argument so bad input gives FinancialDraftInvalidError.

Recommendation: allow me to make these four changes, run the slice 2 tests once, and get one more fresh review (a third round for this slice only). If that review has no should-fix findings, commit slice 2 and continue with slice 3.

Alternative: accept findings 3 and 4 as notes, make only the two test additions (1 and 2), and commit after the targeted run without a third review.
